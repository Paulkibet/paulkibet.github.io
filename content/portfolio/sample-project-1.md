Date: 2023-10-26
Summary: A brief overview of the customer churn analysis project, highlighting the key objectives and outcomes.
Category: Data Analysis

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and to develop a predictive model to flag at-risk customers.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Collection:** Gathered data from various sources including CRM, usage logs, and customer support tickets.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed data into a suitable format for analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Created new features that could improve model performance.
5.  **Model Building:** Trained several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
6.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models based on metrics like AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Results & Impact

The predictive model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.85, enabling the company to proactively engage with customers identified as high-risk, leading to a 15% reduction in churn over the next quarter.
